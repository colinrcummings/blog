If you read my <a href=\"/posts/a-wedding-website/\">previous post</a>, then you know that it’s my go-to library for creating user interfaces (including <a href=\"https://github.com/colinrcummings/blog\">this blog</a>). I was recently asked to give a presentation on React at one of the software development Meetups I attend. I opted to introduce the library, walk through a couple of core concepts (with examples), do a few ad hoc demos and then leave the audience with some additional concepts, resources and tools. Below is an overview of <a href=\"http://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectacle</a>, the library I used to create the presentation.</p>\n<p><a role=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default\" href=\"http://colinrcummings.github.io/meetup-react\" target=\"_blank\">View Presentation</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Spectacle</h2>\n<p>Spectacle bills itself as “A React.js based library for creating sleek presentations”. It’s <em>awesome</em>. Being able to use components to compose a presentation about React felt right from the start. Out of the box, the library provides <a href=\"https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle#tag-api\" target=\"_blank\">tags</a> for core slideshow objects you’re probably already familiar with from another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8\" target=\"_blank\">presentation program</a> that shall not be named. Two things really set Spectacle apart from <a href=\"https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&o=desc&q=presentation&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93\" target=\"_blank\">other web-based presentation tools</a>:</p>\n<h3>Code Slides</h3>\n<p>Embedding code in a presentation isn’t new, but with the <a href=\"https://github.com/thejameskyle/spectacle-code-slide\" target=\"_blank\">spectacle-code-slide</a> extension I was able to step through my example code with syntax highlighting and contextual notes.</p>\n<div class=\"grid\">\n  <div class=\"col-2-12 hide-on-mobile\"></div>\n  <div class=\"col-8-12\">\n    <div class=\"text-center margin-top-5\">\n      <div>\n        <img class=\"img-rounded\" src=\"/blog/images/posts/introduction_to_react/code_slide.gif\" alt=\"Code slide\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-2-12 hide-on-mobile\"></div>\n</div>\n<h3>Embedded Examples</h3>\n<p>Because the entire Spectacle presentation is a React component, I was able to embed my example components into my slides and interact with them live.</p>\n<div class=\"grid\">\n  <div class=\"col-2-12 hide-on-mobile\"></div>\n  <div class=\"col-8-12\">\n    <div class=\"text-center margin-top-5\">\n      <div>\n        <img class=\"img-rounded\" src=\"/blog/images/posts/introduction_to_react/interactive_example.gif\" alt=\"Interactive example\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col-2-12 hide-on-mobile\"></div>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\n<p>Have questions, comments or suggestions?
