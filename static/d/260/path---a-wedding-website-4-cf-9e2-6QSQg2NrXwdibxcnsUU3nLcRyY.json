During a discussion about how to handle RSVPs for the big day, I floated the option of doing it online. This was a welcome idea; however, it meant she needed a website. The question, then, was to buy or build.</p>\n<p>While exploring available options, my suspicions were confirmed: wedding websites are a cottage industry. There’s a hodgepodge of do-it-yourself platforms out there promising a “customized look and feel”, but the enter fiancé name <em>here</em>, and upload photo of you and partner <em>there</em>, routine almost invariably results in a ready-made feel (to say nothing of typically poor user experience on smaller devices). Additionally, one-size-fits-all approaches to online RSVPs tend to entail configuration-heavy setups, busy admin interfaces and less-than-seamless form integration on the guest-facing page.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I opted for build. Below is an overview of what turned out to be a really fun project. I’ve included links to a few resources that I found particularly helpful along the way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://brynne-and-don.herokuapp.com/\">Visit Website</a></p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Now that the wedding has passed, the site’s on a free dyno, which may take a few seconds to spin up. (Fri May 5 2017)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I used the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jkchuynh829/the-nerp-stack-29402b6a4355\">NERP stack</a> with a webpack build, including hot reloading in development, as well as Nodemailer and Bootsrap 4.</p>\n<h3>Back End</h3>\n<p>Node with Express is my go-to server setup these days. I’ve used a couple different build tool combinations in other Node-based projects (Grunt, gulp and/or webpack), but this was the first time I let webpack handle everything—JS(X), (S)CSS, HTML, <a href=\"https://paradite.com/2016/10/25/font-awesome-angular-2-webpack/\">icons</a>, <a href=\"https://shellmonger.com/2016/01/22/working-with-fonts-with-webpack/\">fonts</a> and <a href=\"https://survivejs.com/webpack/loading-assets/loading-/images/\">images</a>. It can capably and quickly do it all, and with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@LopezTech/a-web-application-journey-part-3-webpack-dev-server-and-related-improvements-abd5060bd3fc\">a little extra configuration</a> you get hot reloading for React components in development, which is <em>awesome</em>. I spun up a Postgres database on Heroku to store RSVPs, which is also where the server runs, and used <a href=\"http://mherman.org/blog/2016/03/13/designing-a-restful-api-with-node-and-postgres/#.WLHfR1UrLIV\">pg-promise</a> to execute CRUD actions. I also used <a href=\"http://javascript.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/07/02/send-email-node-js-express/\">Nodemailer</a> to send guest confirmation and admin notification emails via Gmail, which took some extra configuration as it requires <a href=\"http://masashi-k.blogspot.com/2013/06/sending-mail-with-gmail-using-xoauth2.html\">XOAuth2</a>. Lastly, the admin RSVP management page and its associated API routes are protected using Passport local authentication.</p>\n<h3>Front End</h3>\n<p>In conjunction with React, I used an alpha release of <a href=\"https://www.artembutusov.com/webpack-customizable-bootstrap-4-x-scss/\">Bootstrap 4</a> for the framework. I’ve been using version 3 for a few years now, and the short lifecycle of this project gave me an opportunity to test drive some of the <a href=\"https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/\">changes, additions and removals</a> coming in version 4. I also made use of Animate, Moment, Underscore, D3 and Crossfilter in different places.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Guest Splash Page</h2>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> The guest-facing splash page is comprised of 6 sections containing React components; how some components render depends on the current date.</p>\n<h3>Intro</h3>\n<p>This component renders a responsive full screen background image with animated <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/design-considerations-text-/images/\">overlay text</a>, a bouncing chevron icon that triggers some <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/joshcanhelp/a3a669df80898d4097a1e2c01dea52c1\">jQuery-free scroll animation</a> and parallax scrolling on larger devices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/sections/intro.jpg\" alt=\"Intro component\"></p>\n<h3>Actions / Thank You One of the biggest benefits of building user interfaces with React is that it makes conditional rendering really easy. This section renders components differently based on the current date’s relationship to the wedding and RSVP dates. Before the wedding date, this section renders a component with two action buttons: a hook for RSVPs and a link to the Registry.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/sections/actions.jpg\" alt=\"Actions component\"></p>\n<p>As the RSVP date approaches/passes, the RSVP action button renders accordingly.</p>\n<p><em>Open</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/actions/rsvps_open.jpg\" alt=\"RSVPs open\"></p>\n<p><em>Closing Soon</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/actions/rsvps_closing.jpg\" alt=\"RSVPs closing soon\"></p>\n<p><em>Closed</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/actions/rsvps_closed.jpg\" alt=\"RSVPs closed\"></p>\n<p>RSVPs are submitted through a series of modal screens launched from the RSVP action button.</p>\n<p><em>Search</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/modal/search.jpg\" alt=\"RSVP search\"></p>\n<p><em>Form</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/modal/form.jpg\" alt=\"RSVP form\"></p>\n<p><em>Result</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/modal/result.jpg\" alt=\"RSVP result\"></p>\n<p>If the guest provides an email address in the RSVP form, then they receive a confirmation email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/emails/guest_confirmation.jpg\" alt=\"RSVPs open\"></p>\n<p>The admin receives a notification email each time an RSVP is submitted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/rsvps/emails/admin_notification.jpg\" alt=\"RSVPs closing soon\"></p>\n<p>After the wedding date, this section renders a component with a thank you note so the page isn’t anachronistic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/sections/thank_you.jpg\" alt=\"Thank You component\"></p>\n<h3>Bios This component renders bride and groom bios using Bootstrap 4’s new <a href=\"https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/\">Card component</a>.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/images/posts/a_wedding_website/index/sections/bios.jpg\" alt=\"Bios component\"></p>\n<h3>Events This component is based on a <a href=\"https://codyhouse.co/gem/vertical-timeline/\">responsive vertical timeline template</a>.
