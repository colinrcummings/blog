During a discussion about how to handle RSVPs for the big day, I floated the option of doing it online. This was a welcome idea; however, it meant she needed a website. The question, then, was to buy or build.</p>
<p>While exploring available options, my suspicions were confirmed: wedding websites are a cottage industry. There&#x27;s a hodgepodge of do-it-yourself platforms out there promising a &quot;customized look and feel&quot;, but the enter fiancé name <em>here</em>, and upload photo of you and partner <em>there</em>, routine almost invariably results in a ready-made feel (to say nothing of typically poor user experience on smaller devices). Additionally, one-size-fits-all approaches to online RSVPs tend to entail configuration-heavy setups, busy admin interfaces and less-than-seamless form integration on the guest-facing page.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I opted for build. Below is an overview of what turned out to be a really fun project. I&#x27;ve included links to a few resources that I found particularly helpful along the way.</p>
<p><a role="button" class="btn btn-default" href="https://brynne-and-don.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Now that the wedding has passed, the site&#x27;s on a free dyno, which may take a few seconds to spin up. <span class="small text-muted">(Fri May 5 2017)</span></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> I used the <a href="https://medium.com/@jkchuynh829/the-nerp-stack-29402b6a4355" target="_blank">NERP stack</a> with a webpack build, including hot reloading in development, as well as Nodemailer and Bootsrap 4.</p>

<p>Node with Express is my go-to server setup these days. I&#x27;ve used a couple different build tool combinations in other Node-based projects (Grunt, gulp and/or webpack), but this was the first time I let webpack handle everything—JS(X), (S)CSS, HTML, <a href="https://paradite.com/2016/10/25/font-awesome-angular-2-webpack/" target="_blank">icons</a>, <a href="https://shellmonger.com/2016/01/22/working-with-fonts-with-webpack/" target="_blank">fonts</a> and <a href="https://survivejs.com/webpack/loading-assets/loading-images/" target="_blank">images</a>. It can capably and quickly do it all, and with <a href="https://medium.com/@LopezTech/a-web-application-journey-part-3-webpack-dev-server-and-related-improvements-abd5060bd3fc" target="_blank">a little extra configuration</a> you get hot reloading for React components in development, which is <em>awesome</em>. I spun up a Postgres database on Heroku to store RSVPs, which is also where the server runs, and used <a href="http://mherman.org/blog/2016/03/13/designing-a-restful-api-with-node-and-postgres/#.WLHfR1UrLIV" target="_blank">pg-promise</a> to execute CRUD actions. I also used <a target="_blank" href="http://javascript.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/07/02/send-email-node-js-express/">Nodemailer</a> to send guest confirmation and admin notification emails via Gmail, which took some extra configuration as it requires <a href="http://masashi-k.blogspot.com/2013/06/sending-mail-with-gmail-using-xoauth2.html" target="_blank">XOAuth2</a>. Lastly, the admin RSVP management page and its associated API routes are protected using Passport local authentication.</p>
<h3 id="front-end"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#front-end"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Front End</h3>
<p>In conjunction with React, I used an alpha release of <a href="https://www.artembutusov.com/webpack-customizable-bootstrap-4-x-scss/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a> for the framework. I&#x27;ve been using version 3 for a few years now, and the short lifecycle of this project gave me an opportunity to test drive some of the <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/" target="_blank">changes, additions and removals</a> coming in version 4. I also made use of Animate, Moment, Underscore, D3 and Crossfilter in different places.</p>

<h2 id="guest-splash-page"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#guest-splash-page"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Guest Splash Page</h2>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> The guest-facing splash page is comprised of 6 sections containing React components; how some components render depends on the current date.</p>
<h3 id="intro"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#intro"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Intro</h3>
<p>This component renders a responsive full screen background image with animated <a href="https://css-tricks.com/design-considerations-text-images/" target="_blank">overlay text</a>, a bouncing chevron icon that triggers some <a href="https://gist.github.com/joshcanhelp/a3a669df80898d4097a1e2c01dea52c1" target="_blank">jQuery-free scroll animation</a> and parallax scrolling on larger devices.</p>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of building user interfaces with React is that it makes conditional rendering really easy. This section renders components differently based on the current date&#x27;s relationship to the wedding and RSVP dates.</p>
<p>Before the wedding date, this section renders a component with two action buttons: a hook for RSVPs and a link to the Registry.</p>
